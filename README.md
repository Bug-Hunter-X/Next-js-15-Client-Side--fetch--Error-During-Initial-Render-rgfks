# Next.js 15 Client-Side `fetch` Error During Initial Render

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications involving client-side `fetch` calls within page components.  The issue arises during the initial render; the `fetch` call fails because the client-side environment is not yet fully initialized.

**Problem:**

The `about.js` file attempts to use `fetch` to retrieve data from an API route (`/api/data`). This call works correctly after the initial render, but causes the application to crash on the first render.

**Solution:**

The provided solution utilizes `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` to fetch data during the server-side rendering phase. This ensures the data is available for the initial client-side render, preventing the error.
